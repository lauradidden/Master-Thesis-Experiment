# Master-Thesis-Experiment
The purpose of this research project is to evaluate the usefulness, usability, and analytical value of a visualization tool designed to support a process analyst during exploratory process analysis.

## Overview

1. **Prerequisites**:  
   Install LogView and the required packages (explanation below).
3. **Tutorial Phase (at home)**  
   This study begins by executing the tutorial file [`Tutorial.ipynb`](./Tutorial.ipynb), which introduces you to the tools used in the experiment. This ensures you are familiar with the process before taking part in the actual experiment.

4. **Experiment Phase (in the presence of the researcher)**  
   Once the tutorial is complete, you perform the actual experiment using [`Experiment.ipynb`](./Experiment.ipynb), either in person or online, under the supervision of the researcher.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Python 3.9 â€“ 3.12** installed. You can use any environment manager (e.g., `conda`, `venv`). Here's an example using **conda**:

```bash
conda create -n logview_env python=3.10
conda activate logview_env
```

To run the tutorial and experiment notebooks, install the following packages:

```bash
pip install ipykernel pandas pm4py
```


### Installing **LogView**

#### 1. Clone the LogView Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fzerbato/logview.git
cd logview
```

#### 2. Install LogView Locally

```bash
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
pip install .
```
