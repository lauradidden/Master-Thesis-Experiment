# Master-Thesis-Experiment
The purpose of this research project is to evaluate the usefulness, usability, and analytical value of a visualization tool designed to support a process analyst during exploratory process analysis.

## Overview

1. **Install Prerequisites**   
   Install LogView and the required packages (explanation below).
3. **Tutorial (at home)**  
   The first part of the study is a tutorial [`Tutorial.ipynb`](./Tutorial.ipynb), which introduces the tools used in the experiment. This ensures you are familiar with the tools before taking part in the actual experiment.

4. **Experiment (in the presence of the researcher)**  
   The second part is the experiment [`Experiment.ipynb`](./Experiment.ipynb). This will take place once the tutorial is complete, either in person or online, under the supervision of the researcher.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Python 3.9 â€“ 3.12** installed. You can use any environment manager (e.g., `conda`, `venv`). Here's an example using **conda**:

```bash
conda create -n logview_env python=3.10
conda activate logview_env
```

To run the tutorial and experiment notebooks, install the following packages:

```bash
pip install ipykernel pandas pm4py os zipfile
```
