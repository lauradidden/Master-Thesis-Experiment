# Master-Thesis-Experiment
The purpose of this research project is to evaluate the usefulness, usability, and analytical value of a visualization tool designed to support a process analyst during exploratory process analysis.

## Overview

1. **Tutorial (at home)**  
   The first part of the study is a tutorial [`Tutorial.ipynb`](./Tutorial.ipynb), which introduces the tools used in the experiment. This ensures you are familiar with the tools before taking part in the actual experiment.

2. **Experiment (in the presence of the researcher)**  
   The second part is the experiment [`Experiment.ipynb`](./Experiment.ipynb). This will take place once the tutorial is complete, either in person or online, under the supervision of the researcher.
